# Same Origin Policy

__SOP__ is a policy that stops one website from reading or writing data to another website. (ensures basic web security)

The policy checks for three different things in the origin :
1. Protocol
2. Host
3. Port

Only if these three are the same for two different origins, the browser allows cross origin read or write
